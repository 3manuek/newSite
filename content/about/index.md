Hi there! I'm Emanuel Calvo, a Datanerd and Consultant _currently_ located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Working in the Open Source community, as a way to enhance society and promote free and open knowledge. If there is something that made humans as they are today,
is _intelligence_. Been said, contributing to Open Knowledge is the way that humanity can evolve into a more respectful environment within earth and other beings.

I'm a Net Party pair member (_par del Partido de la Red_). Check the [platform](https://docs.partidodelared.org).
